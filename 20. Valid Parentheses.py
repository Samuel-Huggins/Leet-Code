# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
# An input string is valid if:

# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "()"
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "()[]{}"
# Output: true

# Example 3:
# Input: s = "(]"
# Output: false

# Example 4:
# Input: s = "([])"
# Output: true

# Example 5:
# Input: s = "([)]"
# Output: false

# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
